= Memory Estimation

[abstract]
--
This section describes how to estimate memory requirements for the projected graph model used by the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

The graph algorithms library operates completely on the heap, which means we'll need to configure our Neo4j Server with a much larger heap size than we would for transactional workloads.
The diagram belows shows how memory is used by the projected graph model:

The model contains three types of data:

* Node ids - up to 2^45^ ("35 trillion")
* Relationships - pairs of node ids. Relationships are stored twice if `orientation: "UNDIRECTED"` is used.
* Weights - stored as doubles (8 bytes per node) in an array-like data structure next to the relationships

Memory configuration depends on the graph projection that we're using.

This section includes:

* <<estimate-procedure-algo>>
* <<estimate-procedure-graph>>

== Estimating memory requirements for algorithms

In many use cases it will be useful to estimate the required memory of a graph and an algorithm before running it in order to make sure that the workload can run on the available hardware.
To make this process easier every algorithm supports the `.estimate` mode, which returns an estimate of the amount of memory required to run graph algorithms.

.Syntax
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.<ALGO>.<MODE>.estimate(graphNameOrConfig: String|Map, configuration: Map})
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type          | Default   | Optional  | Description
| graphNameOrConfig | string or map | -         | no        | The name of the projected graph or the algorithm configuration in case of implicit loading.
| config            | map           | {}        | yes       | If the first parameter is the name of a projected graph, this parameter is the algorithm config, otherwise it needs to be null or an empty map.
|===

The configuration parameter accepts the same configuration parameters as the estimated algorithm.
See the algorithm documentation for more information.
Additionally the following parameters are supported:

|===
| Name              | Type      | Default           | Optional  | Description
| nodeCount         | int       | 0                 | yes       | The number of nodes in a fictive graph.
| relationshipCount | int       | 0                 | yes       | The number of relationships in a fictive graph.
|===

Setting the `nodeCount` and `relationshipCount` parameters allows a memory estimation without loading the graph.

|===
| Name                  | Type      | Description
| requiredMemory        | string    | An estimation of the required memory in a human readable format.
| treeView              | string    | A more detailed, human readable representation of the required memory, including estimates of the different components.
| mapView               | string    | A more detailed representation of the required memory, including estimates of the different components.
| bytesMin              | int       | The minimum number of bytes required.
| bytesMax              | int       | The maximum number of bytes required.
| nodeCount             | int       | The estimated number of nodes in the graph
| relationshipCount     | int       | The estimated number of relationships in the graph

== Estimating memory requirements for graphs

The <<catalog-graph-create, `gds.graph.create`>> procedures also support `.estimate` to estimate memory usage for just the graph.
Those procedures don't accept the graph name as the first argument, as they don't actually create the graph.

.Syntax
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.estimate(nodeProjection: String|List|Map, relationshipProjection: String|List|Map, configuration: Map})
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name                   | Type                  | Default   | Optional  | Description
| nodeProjection         | string or list or map | -         | no        | The node projection to estimate for.
| relationshipProjection | string or list or map | -         | no        | The relationship projection to estimate for.
| config                 | map                   | {}        | yes       | Additional configuration, such as concurrency.
|===

The <<cypher-projection, `gds.graph.create.cypher`>> procedure has to execute both, the `nodeQuery` and `relationshipQuery`, in order to count the number of nodes and relationships of the graph.

.Syntax
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.cypher.estimate(nodeQuery: String, relationshipQuery: String, configuration: Map})
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type   | Default   | Optional  | Description
| nodeQuery         | string | -         | no        | The node query to estimate for.
| relationshipQuery | string | -         | no        | The relationship query to estimate for.
| config            | map    | {}        | yes       | Additional configuration, such as concurrency.
|===

Both estimate procedures also accept `nodeCount` and `relationshipCount` as configuration keys.
Setting those parameters allows a memory estimation without having to read from the underlying database.
