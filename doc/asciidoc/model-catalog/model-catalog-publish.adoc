Making a model accessible to other users can be achieved by publishing it.

** can also contain algorithm specific model details.
* `trainConfig`: the configuration used for training the model.
* `graphSchema`: the schema of the graph on which the model was trained.
* `stored`: True, if the model is <<catalog-model-store,stored>> on disk.
* `loaded`: True, if the model is <<catalog-model-load,loaded>> in the in-memory model catalog.
* `creationTime`: the time at which the model was registered in the catalog.
* `shared`: a boolean flag indicating if the model is published.
