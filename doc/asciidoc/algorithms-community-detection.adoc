= Community detection algorithms

[abstract]
--
This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the community detection algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

Community detection algorithms are used to evaluate how a group of nodes is clustered or partitioned, as well as its tendency to strengthen or break apart.
Neo4j GDS includes the following community detection algorithms, grouped by quality tier:

* Production-quality:
** <<algorithms-louvain, Louvain>> (`algo.louvain`)
** <<algorithms-label-propagation, Label Propagation>> (`algo.labelPropagation`)
** <<algorithms-wcc, Weakly Connected Components>> (`algo.unionFind`)
* Alpha
** <<algorithms-strongly-connected-components, Strongly Connected Components>> (`algo.scc`)
** <<algorithms-triangle-count-clustering-coefficient, Triangle Counting / Clustering Coefficient>> (`algo.triangleCount`)
** <<algorithms-balanced-triads, Balanced Triads>> (`algo.balancedTriads`)
