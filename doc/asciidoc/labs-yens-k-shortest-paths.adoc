--
This section describes the Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm in the Neo4j Labs Graph Algorithms library.
--

Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm computes single-source K-shortest loopless paths for a graph with non-negative relationship weights.

[[algorithms-yens-k-shortest-path-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Algorithm was defined in 1971 by Jin Y. Yen in the research paper https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.17.11.712[Finding the K Shortest Loopless Paths in a Network].
Our implementation uses Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path and then proceeds to find k-1 deviations of the shortest paths.

== Use-cases - when to use the Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* K-shortest paths algorithm has been used to optimize multiple object tracking by formalizing the motions of targets as flows along the relationships of the spatial graph.
  Find more in https://cvlab.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/cvlab2/files/publications/publications/2011/BerclazFTF11.pdf[Multiple Object Tracking using K-Shortest Paths Optimization]
* K-shortest paths algorithm is used to study alternative routing on road networks and to recommend top k-paths to the user.
  Find this study in https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/gebiete/wbi/research/publications/2015/sigspatial_kshortest.pdf[Alternative Routing: k-Shortest Paths with Limited Overlap]
* K-shortest paths algorithm has been used as part of https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/51e7/8aa2041d595b3871a49f4b92be725199e73d.pdf[Finding Diverse High-Quality Plans for Hypothesis Generation] process.

[[algorithms-yens-k-shortest-path-limitations]]
== Constraints - when not to use the Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm

// tag::constraint[]
Yen's K-Shortest paths algorithm does not support negative weights.
The algorithm assumes that adding a relationship to a path can never make a path shorter - an invariant that would be violated with negative weights.
