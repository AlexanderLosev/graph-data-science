= Memory Requirements

[abstract]
--
This section describes memory requirements for the projected graph model used by the Neo4j Graph Algorithms Library.
--

The graph algorithms library operates completely on the heap, which means we'll need to configure our Neo4j Server with a much larger heap size than we would for transactional workloads.
The diagram belows shows how memory is used by the projected graph model:

The model contains three types of data:

* Node ids - up to 2^45^ ("35 trillion") for `graph: "huge"`
* Relationships - pairs of node ids. Relationships are stored twice if `direction: "BOTH"` config provided.
* Weights - stored as doubles (8 bytes per node) in an array-like data structure next to the relationships

Memory configuration depends on the graph projection that we're using.

This section includes:

* <<estimate-procedure>>

== Estimating memory requirements

In many use cases it will be useful to estimate the required memory of a graph and an algorithm before running it in order to make sure that the workload can run on the available hardware.
To make this process easier every algorithm supports the `.estimate` mode, which returns an estimate of the amount of memory required to run graph algorithms.

.Syntax
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.algo.<ALGO>.<MODE>.estimate(graphNameOrConfig: STRING|MAP, configuration: MAP})
YIELD requiredMemory, treeView, mapView, bytesMin, bytesMax, nodeCount, relationshipCount

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type          | Default   | Optional  | Description
| graphNameOrConfig | string or map | -         | no        | The name of the projected graph or the algorithm configuration in case of implicit loading.
| config            | map           | {}        | yes       | If the first parameter is the name of a projected graph, this parameter is the algorithm config, otherwise it needs to be null or an empty map.
|===

The configuration parameter accepts the same configuration parameters as the estimated algorithm.
See the algorithm documentation for more information.
Additionally the following parameters are supported:

| Name              | Type      | Default           | Optional  | Description
| nodeCount         | int       | 0                 | yes       | The number of nodes in a fictive graph.
| relationshipCount | int       | 0                 | yes       | The number of relationships in a fictive graph.
|===

Setting the `nodeCount` and `relationshipCount` parameters allows a memory estimation without loading the graph.

| Name                  | Type      | Description
| requiredMemory        | string    | An estimation of the required memory in a human readable format.
| treeView              | string    | A more detailed, human readable representation of the required memory, including estimates of the different components.
| mapView               | string    | A more detailed representation of the required memory, including estimates of the different components.
| bytesMin              | int       | The minimum number of bytes required.
| bytesMax              | int       | The maximum number of bytes required.
| nodeCount             | int       | The estimated number of nodes in the graph
| relationshipCount     | int       | The estimated number of relationships in the graph
