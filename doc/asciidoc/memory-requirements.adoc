= Memory Requirements

[abstract]
--
This section describes memory requirements for the projected graph model used by the Neo4j Graph Algorithms Library.
--

The graph algorithms library operates completely on the heap, which means we'll need to configure our Neo4j Server with a much larger heap size than we would for transactional workloads.
The diagram belows shows how memory is used by the projected graph model:

image::graph-model-memory.png[width=500]

The model contains three types of data:

* Node ids - up to 2^45^ ("35 trillion") for `graph: "huge"`
* Relationships - pairs of node ids. Relationships are stored twice if `direction: "BOTH"` config provided.
* Weights - stored as doubles (8 bytes per node) in an array-like data structure next to the relationships

Memory configuration depends on the graph projection that we're using.

This section includes:

* <<algo-memrec-procedure>>
* <<algo-memrec-sample>>
* <<memory-requirements-sample-graphs>>

[[algo-memrec-procedure]]
== `algo.memrec` procedure

The `algo.memrec` procedure returns an estimate of the amount of memory required to run graph algorithms.

.Syntax
[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.memrec(label, relationship, algorithm, config)
----

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name          | Type    | Default        | Optional | Description
| label         | string  | null           | yes      | The label to load from the graph. If null, load all nodes.
| relationship  | string  | null           | yes      | The relationship type to load from the graph. If null, load all relationships.
| algorithm | string  | null     | no      | The name of a graph algorithm or `graph.load` to return the memory requirements for the in memory graph only.
h| Config ||||
| direction     | string  | 'OUTGOING'     | yes      | The relationship-direction to use in the algorithm.
| graph         | string  | 'huge'         | yes      | Use 'huge' when describing the subset of the graph with label and relationship-type parameter. Use 'cypher' for describing the subset with cypher node statement and relationship statement.
| concurrency   | int     | available CPUs | yes      | The number of concurrent threads.
|===

.Config
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name          | Type    | Default        | Optional | Description
| nodeCount         | int  | 0           | no      | The number of nodes in a fictive graph.
| relationshipCount  | int  | 0           | yes      | The number of relationships in a fictive graph.
|===

This allows getting an estimate of the memory requirement to run graph-algorithms on a fictive graph,
defined on its stats.
For explicitly loaded graphs, the config-map needs to contain the graph name in the `graph` key.
Additionally algorithm specific parameters can also be provided as config.

.Results

|===
| Name          | Type    | Description
| requiredMemory         | int     | The required memory in human readable format.
| bytesMin    | int     | The minimum number of bytes required.
| bytesMax | int   | The maximum number of bytes required.
| mapView | Map  | A breakdown of the memory used by different components involved in the execution of a graph algorithm.
|===

[NOTE]
====
`algo.memrec(label, relationship, algorithm, config)` maps to `algo.<algorithm>.memrec(label, relationship, config)`, which means that `CALL algo.memrec(null, null, "pageRank")` is equivalent to `CALL algo.pageRank.memrec(null, null)`

[[algo-memrec-sample]]
== `algo.memrec` sample

This sample will explain the `algo.memrec` procedure, using a Game of Thrones graphs.

.The following creates a graph containing Game of Thrones characters and the interactions between them.
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (c:Character) ASSERT c.id IS UNIQUE;

UNWIND range(1,7) AS season
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://github.com/neo4j-apps/neuler/raw/master/sample-data/got/got-s" + season + "-nodes.csv" AS row
MERGE (c:Character {id: row.Id})
ON CREATE SET c.name = row.Label;

UNWIND range(1,7) AS season
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://github.com/neo4j-apps/neuler/raw/master/sample-data/got/got-s" + season + "-edges.csv" AS row
MATCH (source:Character {id: row.Source})
MATCH (target:Character {id: row.Target})
CALL apoc.merge.relationship(source, "INTERACTS_SEASON" + season, {}, {}, target) YIELD rel
SET rel.weight = toInteger(row.Weight);

.The following computes the amount of memory required by the huge in memory graph for any node label and any relationship type:

=== Cypher graph projection

This graph projection supports graphs up to 2 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships, specfied by Cypher queries that return node ids.

[NOTE]
====
`algo.memrec` executes the provided Cypher queries to compute the number of nodes and relationships in the projected graph.
The results from running the procedure for Cypher graph projections will therefore not be immediate, as they will be with other graph projections.

.The following computes the amount of memory required by the in memory graph for all nodes and relationships:

----
CALL algo.memrec(
  "MATCH (n) RETURN id(n) AS id",
