= Graph creation - Cypher Queries

.Loading a named graph using Cypher queries:
[opts=header,cols="1a,1a"]

|Graph Algorithms v3.5 |Graph Data Science v1.0
2+| Basic Cypher queries, defining source and target:
|
[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.load(
  'myGraph',
  'MATCH (n:MyLabel)
   RETURN id(n) AS id',
  'MATCH (s)-[r:MY_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(t)
   RETURN id(s) AS source, id(t) AS target',
  {
    graph: 'cypher'
  }
)
----
|
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.cypher(
  'myGraph',
  'MATCH (n:MyLabel)
   RETURN id(n) AS id',
  'MATCH (s)-[r:MY_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(t)
   RETURN id(s) AS source, id(t) AS target'
)
----
2+| With concurrency property and Cypher query with relationship property:
|
[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.load(
  'myGraph',
  'MATCH (n:MyLabel)
   RETURN id(n) AS id',
  'MATCH (s)-[r:MY_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(t)
   RETURN
     id(s) AS source,
     id(t) AS target,
     r.myProperty AS weight',
  {
    concurrency: 4,
    graph: 'cypher'
  }
)
