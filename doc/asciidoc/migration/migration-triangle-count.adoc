[[migration-triangle-count]]
= Triangle Counting / Clustering Coefficient

The `alpha` procedures from the namespace `algo.triangleCount` are being replaced by a pair of procedure namespaces:

* <<algorithms-triangle-count, gds.triangleCount>>
* <<algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient, gds.localClusteringCoefficient>>

Everything relating to clustering coefficients has been extracted into a separate algorithm backing `gds.localClusteringCoefficient` procedures.
To compute both triangle count and local clustering coefficient values multiple procedures will be necessary.
