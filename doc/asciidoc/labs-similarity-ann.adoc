= The Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithm

[abstract]
--
This section describes the Approximate Nearest Neighbors algorithm in the Neo4j Labs Graph Algorithms library.
--

[WARNING]
--
The Approximate Nearest Neighbors algorithm was developed by the Neo4j Labs team and is not officially supported.
--


The Approximate Nearest Neighbors algorithm constructs a k-Nearest Neighbors Graph for a set of objects based on a provided similarity algorithm.
The similarity of items is computed based on <<labs-algorithms-similarity-jaccard,Jaccard Similarity>>, <<labs-algorithms-similarity-cosine,Cosine Similarity>>, <<labs-algorithms-similarity-euclidean,Euclidean Distance>>, or <<labs-algorithms-similarity-pearson,Pearson Similarity>>.

The implementation in the library is based on Dong, Charikar, and Li's paper http://www.cs.princeton.edu/cass/papers/www11.pdf[Efficient K-Nearest Neighbor Graph Construction for Generic Similarity Measures^].

[[ann-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Approximate Nearest Neighbors algorithm


We can use the Approximate Nearest Neighbors algorithm to work out the approximate k most similar items to each other.
The corresponding k-Nearest Neighbors Graph can then be used as part of recommendation queries.


[[ann-procedure-sample]]
== Approximate Nearest Neighbors algorithm sample

.The following will create a sample graph:

  (italian:Cuisine {name:'Italian'}),

.The following will return a stream of nodes, along with up to the 3 most similar nodes to them based on Jaccard Similarity:
[source, cypher]
----
 MATCH (p:Person)-[:LIKES]->(cuisine)

   concurrency: 1

Arya and Karin, and Zhen and Michael have the most similar food preferences, with two overlapping cuisines for a similarity of 0.66.
We also have 3 pairs of users who are not similar at all.
We'd probably want to filter those out, which we can do by passing in the `similarityCutoff` parameter.

.The following will find up to 3 similar users for each user, and store a relationship between those users:
[source, cypher]
----
 MATCH (p:Person)-[:LIKES]->(cuisine)
 WITH {item:id(p), categories: collect(id(cuisine))} as userData
 WITH collect(userData) as data
 CALL gds.alpha.ml.ann.write({
  algorithm: 'jaccard',
  data: data,
  similarityCutoff: 0.1,
  showComputations: true,
  concurrency: 1,
  write: true
 })
 YIELD nodes, similarityPairs, write, writeRelationshipType, writeProperty, min, max, mean, p95
 RETURN nodes, similarityPairs, write, writeRelationshipType, writeProperty, min, max, mean, p95
----

[opts="header"]

We then could write a query to find out what types of cuisine that other people similar to us might like.

.The following will find the most similar user to Praveena, and return their favorite cuisines that Praveena doesn't (yet!) like:
[source, cypher]
----
 MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Praveena'})-[:SIMILAR]->(other),
       (other)-[:LIKES]->(cuisine)
 WHERE not((p)-[:LIKES]->(cuisine))
 RETURN cuisine.name AS cuisine, count(*) AS count
 ORDER BY count DESC

| `cuisine` | count
| Italian   | 2

| Lebanese  | 1

[[ann-usage]]
=== Usage

When executing ApproximateNearestNeighbors in parallel, it is possible that results are flaky because of the asynchronous execution fashion of the algorithm.
