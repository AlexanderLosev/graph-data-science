[abstract]
--
This section describes the Page Rank algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Page Rank is an algorithm that measures the *transitive* influence or connectivity of nodes.

It can be computed by either iteratively distributing one node's rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbours or by randomly traversing the graph and counting the frequency of hitting each node during these walks.

[[algorithms-pagerank-intro]]
== Introduction

The Page Rank algorithm measures the importance of each node within the graph, based on the number and quality of incoming relationships.
The underlying assumption is that pages of importance are more likely to receive a higher volume of links from other pages.

Page Rank is defined in the original Google paper as follows:

----
PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))
----

where,

* we assume that a page `A` has pages `T1` to `Tn` which point to it (i.e., are citations).
* `d` is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1.
  It is usually set to 0.85.
* `C(A)` is defined as the number of links going out of page `A`.

| configuration     | map     | n/a            | yes      | Additional configuration, if the first parameter was a graph name.
|===

The `mode` can be substituted with the available modes (`stream`, `write` and `stats`).

.Configuration
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| Name              | Type   | Default           | Optional | Description
| nodeCount         | int    | 0                 | yes      | The number of nodes in a fictive graph.
| relationshipCount | int    | 0                 | yes      | The number of relationships in a fictive graph.
|===

Setting the `nodeCount` and `relationshipCount` parameters allows a memory estimation without loading the graph.
For explicitly loaded graphs, the config-map needs to contain the graph name in the `graph` key.
Additionally algorithm specific parameters can also be provided as config.

== Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (home:Page {name:'Home'})
CREATE (about:Page {name:'About'})
CREATE (product:Page {name:'Product'})
CREATE (links:Page {name:'Links'})
CREATE (a:Page {name:'Site A'})
CREATE (b:Page {name:'Site B'})
CREATE (c:Page {name:'Site C'})
CREATE (d:Page {name:'Site D'})

CREATE (home)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.2}]->(about)
CREATE (home)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.2}]->(links)
CREATE (home)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.6}]->(product)
CREATE (about)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home)
CREATE (product)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home)
CREATE (a)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home)
CREATE (b)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home)
CREATE (c)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home)
CREATE (d)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home)
CREATE (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.8}]->(home)
CREATE (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(a)
CREATE (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(b)
CREATE (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(c)
CREATE (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(d)
----

This graph represents seven pages, linking to another.
Each relationship has a property called `weight`, which describes the importance of the relationship.

[NOTE]
====
In the examples below we will use named graphs and standard projections as the norm.
However, <<cypher-projection, Cypher projection>> and anonymous graphs could also be used.
====

.The following statement will create the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'myGraph',
    'Page',
    'LINKS',
    {
        relationshipProperties: 'weight'
    }
)

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the Page Rank algorithm on this graph.

Personalized Page Rank is a variation of Page Rank which is biased towards a set of `sourceNodes`.
This variant of Page Rank is often used as part of https://www.r-bloggers.com/from-random-walks-to-personalized-pagerank/[recommender systems^].

[[algorithms-pagerank-usage]]
== Usage

There are some things to be aware of when using the Page Rank algorithm:

* If there are no links from within a group of pages to outside of the group, then the group is considered a spider trap.
* Rank sink can occur when a network of pages form an infinite cycle.
* Dead-ends occur when pages have no out-links.
If a page contains a link to another page which has no out-links, the link would be known as a dangling link.
