[abstract]
--
This section describes the Page Rank algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Page Rank is an algorithm that measures the influence or importance of nodes in a directed graph.

It is computed by either iteratively distributing each node's score (originally based on degree) over its neighbours.
Theoretically this is equivalent traversing the graph in a random fashion and counting the frequency of hitting each node during these walks.

[[algorithms-pagerank-intro]]
== Introduction

The Page Rank algorithm measures the importance of each node within the graph, based on the number incoming relationships and the importance of the corresponding source nodes.
The underlying assumption roughly speaking is that a page is only as important as the pages that link to it.

Page Rank is defined in the original Google paper as a function that solves the following equation:

----
PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))
----

where,

* we assume that a page `A` has pages `T1` to `Tn` which point to it (i.e., are citations).
* `d` is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1.
  It is usually set to 0.85.
* `C(A)` is defined as the number of links going out of page `A`.

This equation is used to iteratively update a candidate solution and arrive at an approximate solution to the same equation.

The configuration for the `mutate` mode is similar to the `write` mode.
Instead of specifying a `writeProperty`, we need to specify a `mutateProperty`.
Also, specifying `writeConcurrency` is not possible in `mutate` mode.

The configuration is the same as for the `write` mode.

The `mode` can be substituted with the available modes (`stream`, `write` and `stats`).

The following will estimate the memory requirements for running the algorithm.
The `mode` can be substituted with the available modes (`stream`, `write` and `stats`).

.Run PageRank in estimate mode on a named graph.
[source, cypher]

CREATE (d)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home)
CREATE (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.8}]->(home)
CREATE (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(a)
CREATE (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(b)
CREATE (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(c)

This graph represents seven pages, linking to another.
Each relationship has a property called `weight`, which describes the importance of the relationship.

[NOTE]
====
In the examples below we will use named graphs and standard projections as the norm.
However, <<cypher-projection, Cypher projection>> and anonymous graphs could also be used.

.The following statement will create the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=setup-query]

CALL gds.graph.create(
    'myGraph',
    'Page',
    'LINKS',
    {

Personalized Page Rank is a variation of Page Rank which is biased towards a set of `sourceNodes`.
This variant of Page Rank is often used as part of https://www.r-bloggers.com/from-random-walks-to-personalized-pagerank/[recommender systems^].

[[algorithms-pagerank-usage]]
== Usage

There are some things to be aware of when using the Page Rank algorithm:

* If there are no links from within a group of pages to outside of the group, then the group is considered a spider trap.
* Rank sink can occur when a network of pages form an infinite cycle.
* Dead-ends occur when pages have no out-links.
If a page contains a link to another page which has no out-links, the link would be known as a dangling link.
