Node embedding algorithms compute low-dimensional vector representations of nodes in a graph.
These vectors, also called embeddings, can be used for machine learning.
The Neo4j Graph Data Science library contains the following node embedding algorithms:

* Alpha
** <<algorithms-embeddings-node2vec, Node2Vec>>
** Random Projection
