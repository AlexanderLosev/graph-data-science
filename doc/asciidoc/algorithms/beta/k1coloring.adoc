[[algorithms-k1coloring-intro]]
== Introduction

The K-1 Coloring algorithm assigns a color to every node in the graph, trying to optimize for two objectives:

1. To make sure that every neighbor of a given node has a different color than the node itself.
2. To use as few colors as possible.

Note that the graph coloring problem is proven to be NP-complete, which makes it intractable on anything but trivial graph sizes.
For that reason the implemented algorithm is a greedy algorithm.
Thus it is neither guaranteed that the result is an optimal solution, using as few colors as theoretically possible, nor does it always produce a correct result where no two neighboring nodes have different colors.
However the precision of the latter can be controlled by the number of iterations this algorithm runs.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

[[algorithms-k1coloring-examples]]
== Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (alice:User {name: 'Alice'}),
       (bridget:User {name: 'Bridget'}),
       (charles:User {name: 'Charles'}),
       (doug:User {name: 'Doug'}),

       (alice)-[:LINK]->(bridget),
       (alice)-[:LINK]->(charles),
       (alice)-[:LINK]->(doug),
       (bridget)-[:LINK]->(charles)
----

This graph has a super node with name "Alice" that connects to all other nodes.
It should therefore not be possible for any other node to be assigned to the color as the Alice node.
In the following examples we will demonstrate using the K-1 Coloring algorithm on this graph.

[[algorithms-k1coloring-examples-projection]]
=== Named graphs and Cypher projections

In the examples below, we will rely on the _implicit_ loading of graphs for the algorithm computation.
However, like other algorithms K-1 Coloring also accepts _named graphs_ and _Cypher projections_ as inputs.
See <<graph-catalog-ops>> for more details.

.Using a named graph:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create('myGraph', 'User', 'LINK');

CALL gds.beta.k1coloring.stream('myGraph')
YIELD nodeId, color
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, color
ORDER BY name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| name      | color
| "Alice"   | 2
| "Bridget" | 1
| "Charles" | 0
| "Doug"    | 0
|===

.Using a Cypher projection:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.beta.k1coloring.stream({
  nodeQuery: 'MATCH (n:User) RETURN id(n) AS id',
  relationshipQuery: 'MATCH (s:User)-[:LINK]->(t:User) RETURN id(s) AS source, id(t) AS target'
})
YIELD nodeId, color
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, color
ORDER BY name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| name      | color
| "Alice"   | 2
| "Bridget" | 1
| "Charles" | 0
| "Doug"    | 0
|===

These results are identical to those of the named graph, as the Cypher projection we use mimics the behaviour of the default loading configuration.
Of course, the Cypher projection feature enables more advanced control over which exact parts of the graph to compute over; please see <<cypher-projection>> for more details.
