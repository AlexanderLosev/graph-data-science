[[algorithms-k1coloring-intro]]
== Introduction

The K-1 Coloring algorithm assigns a color to every node in the graph, trying to optimize for two objectives:

1. To make sure that every neighbor of a given node has a different color than the node itself.
2. To use as few colors as possible.

Note that the graph coloring problem is proven to be NP-complete, which makes it intractable on anything but trivial graph sizes.
For that reason the implemented algorithm is a greedy algorithm.
Thus it is neither guaranteed that the result is an optimal solution, using as few colors as theoretically possible, nor does it always produce a correct result where no two neighboring nodes have different colors.
However the precision of the latter can be controlled by the number of iterations this algorithm runs.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

Running this algorithm requires sufficient memory availability.
Before running this algorithm, we recommend that you read <<memory-estimation>>.

[[algorithms-k1coloring-examples]]
== Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (alice:User {name: 'Alice'}),
       (bridget:User {name: 'Bridget'}),
       (charles:User {name: 'Charles'}),
       (doug:User {name: 'Doug'}),

       (alice)-[:LINK]->(bridget),
       (alice)-[:LINK]->(charles),
       (alice)-[:LINK]->(doug),
       (bridget)-[:LINK]->(charles)
----

This graph has a super node with name "Alice" that connects to all other nodes.
It should therefore not be possible for any other node to be assigned the same color as the Alice node.

[NOTE]
====
In the examples below we will use named graphs and standard projections as the norm.
However, <<cypher-projection, Cypher projection>> and anonymous graphs could also be used.
====

.The following statement will create the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create('myGraph', 'Person', 'LIKES')
----

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the K-1 Coloring algorithm on this graph.

.Running the K-1 Coloring algorithm in stream mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.beta.k1coloring.stream('myGraph')
YIELD nodeId, color
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, color
ORDER BY name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| name      | color
| "Alice"   | 2
| "Bridget" | 1
| "Charles" | 0
| "Doug"    | 0
|===

It is also possible to write the assigned colors back to the database using the `write` mode.

.Running the K-1 Coloring algorithm in write mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.beta.k1coloring.write('myGraph', {writeProperty: 'color'})
YIELD nodes, colorCount, ranIterations, didConverge
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m,1m,1m"]
|===
| nodes | colorCount | ranIterations | didConverge
| 4     | 3          | 3             | true
|===

When using `write` mode the procedure will return information about the algorithm execution.
In this example we return the number of processed nodes, the number of colors used to color the graph, the number of iterations and information whether the algorithm converged.
