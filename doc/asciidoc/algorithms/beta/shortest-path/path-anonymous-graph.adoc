| Name          | Type    | Default | Optional | Description
| sourceNode    | Integer | n/a     | no       | The Neo4j node id of the source node.
| targetNode    | Integer | n/a     | no       | The Neo4j node id of the target node.
| writeNodeIds  | Boolean | false   | yes      | Iff true, the written relationship has a nodeIds list property.
| writeCosts    | Boolean | false   | yes      | Iff true, the written relationship has a costs list property.

The results are the same as for running write mode with a named graph, see the write mode syntax above.
