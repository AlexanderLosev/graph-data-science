This chapter provides explanations and examples for the supervised machine learning models in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

The machine learning procedures in Neo4j GDS allow you to train supervised machine learning models.
Models can then be accessed via the <<model-catalog-ops, Model Catalog>> and used to make predictions about your graph.
It is often useful to enrich the input graph with other GDS algorithms, for example node embedding algorithms.

The Neo4j GDS library includes the following machine learning models, grouped by quality tier:

* Alpha
** <<algorithms-ml-nodeclassification, Node Classification>>
** <<algorithms-ml-linkprediction, Link Prediction>>
