| relationshipWeightProperty | String  | null    | yes      | The relationship property that contains the weight. If `null`, the graph is treated as unweighted. Must be numeric.

| seedProperty               | String  | n/a     | yes      | Used to set the initial component for a node. The property value needs to be a number.
| threshold                  | Float   | null    | yes      | The value of the weight above which the relationship is considered in the computation.
| consecutiveIds             | Boolean | false   | yes      | Flag to decide whether component identifiers are mapped into a consecutive id space (requires additional memory).
