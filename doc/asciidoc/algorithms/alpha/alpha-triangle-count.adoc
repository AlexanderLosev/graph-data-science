= Triangle Counting / Clustering Coefficient

[abstract]
--
This section describes the Triangle Count or Clustering Coefficient algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Triangle counting is a community detection graph algorithm that is used to determine the number of triangles passing through each node in the graph.
A triangle is a set of three nodes, where each node has a relationship to all other nodes.

[[algorithms-triangle-count-clustering-coefficient-context]]
== History and explanation

Triangle counting gained popularity in social network analysis, where it is used to detect communities and measure the cohesiveness of those communities.
It can also be used to determine the stability of a graph, and is often used as part of the computation of network indices, such as the clustering coefficient.

There are two types of clustering coefficient:

Local clustering coefficient::
 The local clustering coefficient of a node is the likelihood that its neighbours are also connected.
 The computation of this score involves triangle counting.

Global clustering coefficient::
 The global clustering coefficient is the normalized sum of those local clustering coefficients.

The transitivity coefficient of a graph is sometimes used, which is three times the number of triangles divided by the number of triples in the graph.

== Use-cases - when to use the Triangle Counting / Clustering Coefficient algorithmÂ 

* Triangle count and clustering coefficient have been shown to be useful as features for classifying a given website as spam, or non-spam, content.
  This is described in http://chato.cl/papers/becchetti_2007_approximate_count_triangles.pdf["Efficient Semi-streaming Algorithms for Local Triangle Counting in Massive Graphs"].
* Clustering coefficient has been used to investigate the community structure of Facebook's social graph, where they found dense neighbourhoods of users in an otherwise sparse global graph.
  Find this study in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.4503.pdf["The Anatomy of the Facebook Social Graph"].
* Clustering coefficient has been proposed to help explore thematic structure of the web, and detect communities of pages with a common topic based on the reciprocal links between them.
  For more information, see http://www.pnas.org/content/99/9/5825[Curvature of co-links uncovers hidden thematic layers in the World Wide Web].

       (karin:Person {name: 'Karin'}),

CALL gds.alpha.triangle.stream({

| nodeA   | nodeB | nodeC

| Michael | Chris | Will

|===

We can see that there are `KNOWS` triangles containing "Will, Michael, and Chris", "Will, Mark, and Michael", and "Michael, Karin, and Chris".
This means that everybody in the triangle knows each other.

.The following will count the number of triangles that a node is member of, and write it back. It will return the total triangle count and average clustering coefficient of the given graph:

      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
    }

.The following will count the number of triangles that a node is member of, and return a stream with `nodeId` and `triangleCount`:

  relationshipProjection: {
    KNOWS: {
      type: 'KNOWS',
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
    }
  },
  concurrency: 4
})
YIELD nodeId, triangles, coefficient
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, triangles, coefficient
ORDER BY coefficient DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| name      | triangles | coefficient
| "Karin"   | 1         | 1.0
| "Mark"    | 1         | 1.0
| "Chris"   | 2         | 0.6666666666666666
| "Will"    | 2         | 0.6666666666666666
| "Michael" | 3         | 0.3
| "Alice"   | 0         | 0.0

We learn that Michael is part of the most triangles, but it's Karin and Mark who are the best at introducing their friends - all of the people who know them, know each other!


[[algorithms-triangle-count-clustering-coefficient-example]]
== Example usage

In graph theory, a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient[clustering coefficient] is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
Evidence suggests that in most real-world networks, and in particular social networks, nodes tend to create tightly knit groups characterised by a relatively high density of ties; this likelihood tends to be greater than the average probability of a tie randomly established between two nodes.

We check if this holds true for Yelp's social network of friends:

[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.alpha.triangleCount.write({
  nodeProjection: 'Person',
  relationshipProjection: {
    FRIEND: {
      type: 'FRIEND',
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
    }
  },
  concurrency: 4,
  writeProperty: 'triangles',
  clusteringCoefficientProperty: 'coefficient'
})
YIELD nodeCount, triangleCount, averageClusteringCoefficient
----

Average clustering coefficient is 0.0523, which is really low for a social network.
This indicates that groups of friends are not tightly knit together, but rather sparse.
We can assume that users are not on Yelp for finding and creating friends, like Facebook for example, but rather something else, like finding good restaurant recommendations.

Local triangle count and clustering coefficient of nodes can be used as features in finding influencers in social networks.
