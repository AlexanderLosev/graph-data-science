| Name                          | Type          | Default         | Optional  | Description
| embeddingSize                 | Integer       | n/a             | no        | The dimension of the computed node embeddings.
| sparsity                      | Integer       | 3               | yes       | The expected proportion of non-zero elements in the initial random vectors is `1/sparsity`.
| iterationWeights              | List<Float>   | [0.0, 1.0, 1.0] | yes       | Contains a weight for each iteration. The weight controls how much the intermediate embedding from the iteration contributes to the final embedding.
| normalizationStrength         | Float         | 0               | yes       | The initial random vector for each node is scaled by its degree to the power of `normalizationStrength`.
| relationshipWeightProperty    | String        | null            | yes       | The name of the relationship property used for weighted random projection
5+| The number of iterations is equal to the length of `iterationWeights`.
