= Neo4j Labs Graph Algorithms

[abstract]
--
This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the algorithms in the Neo4j Labs Graph Algorithms library.
--

The Neo4j Labs Graph Algorithms library contain a number of algorithms developed and maintained as part of Neo4j Labs.
The algorithms are accessed via Cypher by calling procedures, just like the official product algorithms.

[WARNING]
--
The Neo4j Labs algorithms were developed by the Neo4j labs team and are not officially supported.
--

The documentation for the Neo4j Labs algorithms is divided into the following sections:

* <<labs-procedures>>
* <<labs-algorithms-linkprediction>>
* <<labs-algorithms-preprocessing>>
* <<labs-graph-generation>>
