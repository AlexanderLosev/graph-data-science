[[algorithms-ml-linkprediction-intro]]
== Introduction

Link prediction is a common machine learning task applied to graphs: training a model to learn, between pairs of nodes in a graph, where relationships should exist.
You can think of this as building a model to predict missing relationships in your dataset or relationships that are likely to form in the future.
Neo4j GDS trains supervised machine learning models based on the relationships and node properties in your graph to predict the existence - and probability - of relationships.

The basic work flow of Link Prediction contains the following parts which are described below:

* <<algorithms-ml-train-test-splitting, Creating training and test graphs>>
* <<algorithms-ml-linkprediction-train, Training and Evaluating model candidates>>
* <<algorithms-link-prediction-mutate, Applying a model for prediction>>

[[algorithms-ml-linkprediction-train]]
=== Training, Model Selection and Evaluation

When building a model, it is possible to specify multiple model configurations and a model selection metric.
The train mode, `gds.alpha.ml.linkPrediction.train`, is responsible for training and evaluating the models, selecting the best model, and storing it in the model catalog.

The train mode takes as input two relationship types representing the training graph and test graph respectively.
The relationship types must have an integer property, with values being either `0` or `1`.
If the value is `0` the relationship represents a negative example, meaning a node pair which is not connected in the original graph.
If the value is `1` the relationship represents a positive example, meaning a relationship which does exist in the original graph.

To obtain the feature vector for an example, the algorithm first forms node feature vectors for the source and target nodes of the example in question.
This is done by concatenating the property values of the specified feature properties in order into a node feature vector.
Thereafter, the algorithm uses a _link feature combiner_ to combine the two node feature vectors into the feature vector for the training example.
There are two supported link feature combiners.
One is called `L2` and gives the feature vector [(s_0 - t_0)^2 , (s_1 - t_1)^2, ..., (s_d - t_d)^2], where [s_i] and [t_i] are the source and target node feature vectors.
The other link feature combiner is `HADAMARD` which gives [s_0 * t_0, s_1 * t_1, ..., s_d * t_d].

The precise steps of the train mode are:

1. The relationships of the training graph are divided into a number of folds, consisting of a training part and a validation part.
2. Each model candidate is trained on each train part and evaluated on the respective validation part.
   The training process uses a logistic regression algorithm, and the evaluation uses the <<algorithms-ml-metrics, AUCPR metric>>.
3. The model with the highest average score according to the metric will win the training.
4. The winning model will then be re-trained on the whole training graph and evaluated on the training graph as well as on the test graph.
5. The winning model will be registered in the <<model-catalog-ops, Model Catalog>>.

Trained models may then be used to predict the probability of a relationship between two nodes.

[[algorithms-link-prediction-mutate]]
=== Applying a Link Prediction model
A previously trained model can be applied by invoking the `gds.alpha.ml.linkPrediction.predict.mutate` mode.
This will retrieve the model by name from the model catalog.
The model will thereby be used to predict the probability of relationships between all node pairs in the graph that are not connected.
To limit the size of output, one may specify parameters `topN` that will retain the most probable predictions and/or `threshold` which will retain predictions whose probability is above the threshold.

[[algorithms-ml-train-test-splitting]]
=== Train/Test Splitting

In order to train a Link Prediction model, one needs training and test graphs as described <<algorithms-ml-linkprediction-train, above>>.
The recommended way to obtain these is by using <<algorithms-split-relationships, `gds.alpha.ml.splitRelationships()`>> procedure, once to produce the test graph, and another time for the training graph.
By invoking this procedure the first time, one obtains two new relationship types that represent the test graph and a 'remaining' graph.
One can then, invoke the procedure again, on the just created 'remaining' graph, which then creates a training graph and an even smaller 'remaining' graph.
<<algorithms-ml-linkprediction-examples-train, Below>>, is an example usage of how the `splitRelationships` procedure can be used to prepare the required datasets for training.

The 'remaining' graph after the second split can optionally be used to create node embeddings without data leakage from test or validation sets.

Note that, after the first invocation, we cannot use the 'remaining' graph as the training graph, because it not guaranteed to have `0/1` value relationship labels nor negative link examples.

[[algorithms-ml-metrics]]
=== Metrics

The Link Prediction model in the Neo4j GDS library supports only the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve metric, abbreviated as AUCPR.
However, most graphs have far more non-connected node pairs than connected ones.
Thus, typically we have an issue with _class imbalance_.

We will denote by `classRatio` the ratio of non-connected node pairs to connected node pairs.

Evaluating the performance of a model candidate naively using graphs created by the `splitRelationships` procedure can give highly skewed results due to the equal sampling of positive and negative examples.
In order to compensate for the skewed class sampling, one can provide a value for the `classRatio` parameter to the `train` mode.
This will then weigh the models' false positives higher by a factor of `classRatio`.

With the graph in Neo4j we can now project it into the graph catalog to prepare it for algorithm execution.
We do this using a native projection targeting the `Person` nodes and the `KNOWS` relationships.
We will also project the `numberOfPosts` property, so we can use it as a model feature.
For the relationships we must use the `UNDIRECTED` orientation.
This is because the Link Prediction model is defined only for undirected graphs.

include::../../shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will create a graph using a native projection and store it in the graph catalog under the name 'myGraph'.
[source, cypher, role=graph-create-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
  'myGraph',
  {
    Person: {
      properties: ['numberOfPosts']
    }
  },
  {
    KNOWS: {
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
    }
  }
)
----

WARNING: The Link Prediction model requires the graph to be created using the `UNDIRECTED` orientation for relationships.

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the Link Prediction model on this graph.


[[algorithms-ml-linkprediction-examples-train]]
=== Train

First, we must do the test/train splits.
For this we will make use of the `gds.alpha.ml.splitRelationships` procedure.
We will do one split to generate the test graph.

[source, cypher, role=example-query]
----
CALL gds.alpha.ml.splitRelationships.mutate('myGraph', {
  relationshipTypes: ['KNOWS'],
  remainingRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_REMAINING',
  holdoutRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_TESTGRAPH',
  holdoutFraction: 0.2
}) YIELD relationshipsWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| relationshipsWritten
| 24
|===

We will create copied relationships for each existing relationship, into either the `KNOWS_REMAINING` or the `KNOWS_TESTGRAPH` relationship types.
All relationships in `KNOWS_TESTGRAPH` will have a `label` property.
Additionally, a number of non-existing relationships will be created into the `KNOWS_TESTGRAPH` relationship type to be used as negative examples, with a `label` of `0`.

Next, we will create the train graph.

[source, cypher, role=example-query]
----
CALL gds.alpha.ml.splitRelationships.mutate('myGraph', {
  relationshipTypes: ['KNOWS_REMAINING'],
  remainingRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_IGNORED_FOR_TRAINING',
  holdoutRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_TRAINGRAPH',
  holdoutFraction: 0.2
}) YIELD relationshipsWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| relationshipsWritten
| 20
|===

With both training and test graphs, we are ready to train models.
We will use 5 validation folds, meaning we will split the train graph into 5 pairs, using one part of each pair for training and one for validation.
We set the class ratio to 1.33, which is calculated as the number of non-existing relationships over the number of existing relationships.
In our graph we have 8 nodes, which gives us a maximum of `8 * 7 / 2 = 28` undirected relationships.
We have 12 actual relationships, giving us a class ratio of `(28 - 12) / 12 = 1.33`.

[[algorithms-ml-linkprediction-examples-train-query]]
.Train a Link Prediction model:
[source, cypher, role=example-query]
----
CALL gds.alpha.ml.linkPrediction.train('myGraph', {
  trainRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_TRAINGRAPH',
  testRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_TESTGRAPH',
  modelName: 'lp-numberOfPosts-model',
  featureProperties: ['numberOfPosts'],
  validationFolds: 5,
  classRatio: 1.33,
  randomSeed: 2,
  params: [
    {penalty: 0.5, maxIterations: 1000},
    {penalty: 1.0, maxIterations: 1000},
    {penalty: 0.0, maxIterations: 1000}
  ]
}) YIELD modelInfo
RETURN
  modelInfo.bestParameters AS winningModel,
  modelInfo.metrics.AUCPR.outerTrain AS trainGraphScore,
  modelInfo.metrics.AUCPR.test AS testGraphScore
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| winningModel                        | trainGraphScore    | testGraphScore
| {maxIterations: 1000, penalty: 0.5} | 0.7145922746781116 | 0.3512042965360351
|===

Here we can observe that the model candidate with penalty 0.5 performed the best in the training phase, with a score of about 71% over the train graph.
On the test graph, the model scored much lower at about 35%.
This indicates that the model reacted fairly well to the train graph, but did not generalise very well to unseen data.
In order to achieve a higher test score, we may need to use better features, a larger graph, or different model configuration.


[[algorithms-ml-linkprediction-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

In this example we will show how to use a trained model to predict new relationships in your in-memory graph.
In order to do this, we must first have an already trained model registered in the Model Catalog.
We will use the model which we trained in the <<algorithms-ml-linkprediction-examples-train-query, train example>> which we gave the name `'lp-numberOfPosts-model'`.

We must also make sure that we do not include any of the relationships from the train or test graphs, which we do by specifying a relationship filter for the original relationship type `'KNOWS'`.

[source, cypher, role=example-query]
----
CALL gds.alpha.ml.linkPrediction.predict.mutate('myGraph', {
  relationshipTypes: ['KNOWS'],
  modelName: 'lp-numberOfPosts-model',
  mutateRelationshipType: 'KNOWS_PREDICTED',
  topN: 5,
  threshold: 0.45
}) YIELD relationshipsWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| relationshipsWritten
| 10
|===

We specified `threshold` to filter out predictions with probability less than 45%, and `topN` to further limit output to the top 5 relationships.
Because we are using the `UNDIRECTED` orientation, we will write twice as many relationships to the in-memory graph.

In order to analyze our predicted relationships we will write them back to Neo4j:

[source, cypher, role=example-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.writeRelationship('myGraph', 'KNOWS_PREDICTED', 'probability')
YIELD relationshipsWritten, propertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| relationshipsWritten | propertiesWritten
| 10                   | 10
|===

The end result looks like this:

image::example-graphs/link-prediction-mutate.svg[align="center"]

In yellow we highlight the predicted relationships.
