| Name           | Type    | Default         | Optional | Description
| batchSize      | Integer | 100             | yes      | Number of nodes per batch.
| minIterations  | Integer | 1               | yes      | Minimum number of training epochs.
| maxIterations  | Integer | 100             | yes      | Maximum number of training epochs.
| maxStreakCount | Integer | 1               | yes      | Maximum number of unproductive consecutive epochs.
| tolerance      | Float   | 0.001           | yes      | Epochs that do not improve the loss by a factor of 1 - `tolerance` are considered unproductive.
| sharedUpdater  | Boolean | false           | yes      | Whether to use a shared ADAM optimizer across training threads.
| concurrency    | Integer | see description | yes      | Concurrency for training the model candidate. By default the value of the top level `concurrency` parameter is used.
