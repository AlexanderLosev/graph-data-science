[[algorithms-sllpa-intro]]
== Introduction

The Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLLPA) is a variation of the Label Propagation algorithm that is able to detect multiple communities per node.
The GDS implementation is based on the https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.5720.pdf[SLPA: Uncovering Overlapping Communities in Social Networks via A Speaker-listener Interaction Dynamic Process] publication by Xie et al.

The algorithm is randomized in nature and will not produce deterministic results.
To accommodate this, we recommend using a higher number of iterations.

== Examples

:algorithm-name: {algorithm}
:graph-description: social network
:image-file: sllpa.svg
include::../../shared/examples-intro.adoc[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (a:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (b:Person {name: 'Bob'}),
  (c:Person {name: 'Carol'}),
  (d:Person {name: 'Dave'}),
  (e:Person {name: 'Eve'}),
  (f:Person {name: 'Fredrick'}),
  (g:Person {name: 'Gary'}),
  (h:Person {name: 'Hilda'}),
  (i:Person {name: 'Ichabod'}),
  (j:Person {name: 'James'}),
  (k:Person {name: 'Khalid'}),

  (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b),
  (a)-[:KNOWS]->(c),
  (a)-[:KNOWS]->(d),
  (b)-[:KNOWS]->(c),
  (b)-[:KNOWS]->(d),
  (c)-[:KNOWS]->(d),

  (b)-[:KNOWS]->(e),
  (e)-[:KNOWS]->(f),
  (f)-[:KNOWS]->(g),
  (g)-[:KNOWS]->(h),

  (h)-[:KNOWS]->(i),
  (h)-[:KNOWS]->(j),
  (h)-[:KNOWS]->(k),
  (i)-[:KNOWS]->(j),
  (i)-[:KNOWS]->(k),
  (j)-[:KNOWS]->(k);
----

In the example, we will use the SLLPA algorithm to find the communities in the graph.

.The following statement will create the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=graph-create-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
  'myGraph',
  'Person',
  {
    KNOWS: {
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
    }
  }
);
----

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the SLLPA algorithm on this graph.

CALL gds.alpha.sllpa.stream('myGraph', {maxIterations: 100, minInfluence: 0.1})
YIELD nodeId, values
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, values.communityIds AS communityIds

| "Ichabod"  | [1]
| "James"    | [1]
| "Khalid"   | [1]
2+|11 rows

Due to the randomness of the algorithm, the results will tend to vary between runs.
