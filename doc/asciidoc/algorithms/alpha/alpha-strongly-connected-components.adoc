= The Strongly Connected Components algorithm

[abstract]
--
This section describes the Strongly Connected Components algorithm in the Neo4j Labs Graph Algorithms library.
--

The Strongly Connected Components (SCC) algorithm finds maximal sets of connected nodes in a directed graph.
A set is considered a strongly connected component if there is a directed path between each pair of nodes within the set.
It is often used early in a graph analysis process to help us get an idea of how our graph is structured.


[WARNING]
--
The Strongly Connected Components algorithm was developed by the Neo4j Labs team and is not officially supported.

[[algorithms-strongly-connected-components-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
SCC is one of the earliest graph algorithms, and the first linear-time algorithm was described by Tarjan in 1972.
Decomposing a directed graph into its strongly connected components is a classic application of the depth-first search algorithm.

== Use-cases - when to use the Strongly Connected Components algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* In the analysis of powerful transnational corporations, SCC can be used to find the set of firms in which every member owns directly and/or indirectly owns shares in every other member.
  Although it has benefits, such as reducing transaction costs and increasing trust, this type of structure can weaken market competition.
  Read more in http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025995&type=printable["The Network of Global Corporate Control"^].
* SCC can be used to compute the connectivity of different network configurations when measuring routing performance in multihop wireless networks.
  Read more in https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=513803["Routing performance in the presence of unidirectional links in multihop wireless networks"^]
* Strongly Connected Components algorithms can be used as a first step in many graph algorithms that work only on strongly connected graph.
  In social networks, a group of people are generally strongly connected (For example, students of a class or any other common place).
  Many people in these groups generally like some common pages, or play common games.
  The SCC algorithms can be used to find such groups, and suggest the commonly liked pages or games to the people in the group who have not yet liked those pages or games.

// tag::stream-sample-graph-explanation[]
We have 3 strongly connected components in our sample graph.

The first, and biggest, component has members Alice, Bridget, and Michael, while the second component has Doug and Mark.
Charles ends up in his own component because there isn't an outgoing relationship from that node to any of the others.
