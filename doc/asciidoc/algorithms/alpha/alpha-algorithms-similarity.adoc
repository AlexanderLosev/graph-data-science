= Similarity algorithms

[abstract]
--
This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the similarity algorithms in the Neo4j Labs Graph Algorithms library.
--

These algorithms help calculate the similarity of nodes:

* <<labs-algorithms-similarity-jaccard, Jaccard Similarity>>
* <<labs-algorithms-similarity-cosine, Cosine Similarity>>
* <<labs-algorithms-similarity-pearson, Pearson Similarity>>
* <<labs-algorithms-similarity-euclidean, Euclidean Distance>>
* <<labs-algorithms-similarity-overlap, Overlap Similarity>>
* <<labs-algorithms-approximate-nearest-neighbors, Approximate Nearest Neighbors>>
