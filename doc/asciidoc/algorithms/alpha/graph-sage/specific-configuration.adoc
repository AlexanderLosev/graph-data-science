| Name                      | Type          | Default   | Optional  | Description
| embeddingSize             | Integer       | n/a       | no        | The size of the generated embedding list.
| aggregator                | String        | n/a       | no        | What Aggregator to be used by the layers. Supported values are "mean" and "pool".
| activationFunction        | String        | n/a       | no        | The activation function to be used during training. Supported values are "sigmoid" and "relu".
| sampleSizes               | List<Integer> | n/a       | no        | An array of Integer values, the size of the array determines the number of layers and the values determine how many nodes will be sampled by the layer at the corresponding index.
| nodePropertyNames         | List<String>  | []        | yes       | An array of node property names. The in-memory graph has to be created with a super-set of these property names.
| batchSize                 | Integer       | 100       | yes       | The number of nodes per batch.
| tolerance                 | Double        | 1e-4      | yes       | Tolerance controls the training cycles. The training will complete when Loss changes less than `tolerance` which may happen before the epochs and/or maxOptimizationIterations are exhausted.
| learningRate              | Double        | 0.1       | yes       | Controls the size of updates during training.
| epochs                    | Integer       | 1         | yes       | Number of times to traverse the graph during training.
| maxOptimizationIterations | Integer       | 100       | yes       | Maximum number of parameter updates per epoch and batch.
| searchDepth               | Integer       | 5         | yes       | Depth of a RandomWalk when sampling neighbors during training. This is used when computing the Loss function.
| negativeSamples           | Integer       | 20        | yes       | The number of negative samples. This is used when computing the Loss function.
| degreeAsProperty          | Boolean       | false     | yes       | Whether or not to use the degree of the node as node property.
5+| *Note*: Either `nodePropertyNames` or `degreeAsProperty` (or both) have to be specified.
