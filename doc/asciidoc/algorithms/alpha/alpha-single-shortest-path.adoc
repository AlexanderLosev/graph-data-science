= The Single Source Shortest Path algorithm

[abstract]
--
This section describes the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm in the Neo4j Labs Graph Algorithms library.
--

The Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm calculates the shortest (weighted) path from a node to all other nodes in the graph.

[WARNING]
--
The Single Source Shortest Path algorithm was developed by the Neo4j Labs team and is not officially supported.

[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-context]]
== History and explanation

SSSP came into prominence at the same time as the shortest path algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm can act as an implementation for both problems.

We implement a delta-stepping algorithm that has been https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02113v1.pdf[shown to outperform Dijkstra's^].


[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First[Open Shortest Path First^] is a routing protocol for IP networks.
It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to help detect changes in topology, such as link failures, and https://routing-bits.com/2009/08/06/ospf-convergence/[come up with a new routing structure in seconds^].


[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-limitations]]
== Constraints - when not to use the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm

Delta stepping does not support negative weights.
The algorithm assumes that adding a relationship to a path can never make a path shorter - an invariant that would be violated with negative weights.

.The following will run the algorithm and write back results:

CALL gds.alpha.shortestPath.deltaStepping.write(configuration: Map)
YIELD nodeCount, loadDuration, evalDuration, writeDuration

| relationshipWeightProperty    | string  | null     | yes      | The property name that contains weight. If null, treats the graph as unweighted. Must be numeric.
| delta             | float   | null     | yes      | The grade of concurrency to use.
| writeProperty     | string  | 'sssp'   | yes      | The property name written back to the node sequence of the node in the path. The property contains the cost it takes to get from the start node to the specific node.
