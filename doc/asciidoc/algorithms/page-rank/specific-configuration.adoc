| Name                       | Type    | Default   | Optional | Description
| dampingFactor              | Float   | 0.85      | yes      | The damping factor of the Page Rank calculation.
| maxIterations              | Integer | 20        | yes      | The maximum number of iterations of Page Rank to run.
| tolerance                  | Float   | 0.0000001 | yes      | Minimum change in scores between iterations. If all scores change less than the tolerance value the result is considered stable and the algorithm returns.
| relationshipWeightProperty | String  | null      | yes      | The property name that contains weight. If null, treats the graph as unweighted. Must be numeric.
| sourceNodes                | List    | []        | yes      | A set of nodes to use for computing Personalized Page Rank.
