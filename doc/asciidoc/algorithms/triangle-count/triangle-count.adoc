[[algorithms-triangle-count-intro]]
== Introduction

The Triangle Count algorithm counts the number of triangles for each node in the graph.
A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node has a relationship to the other two.
In graph theory terminology, this is sometimes referred to as a 3-clique.

Triangle counting has gained popularity in social network analysis, where it is used to detect communities and measure the cohesiveness of those communities.
It can also be used to determine the stability of a graph, and is often used as part of the computation of network indices, such as clustering coefficients.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

* Triangle count and clustering coefficient have been shown to be useful as features for classifying a given website as spam, or non-spam, content.
This is described in http://chato.cl/papers/becchetti_2007_approximate_count_triangles.pdf["Efficient Semi-streaming Algorithms for Local Triangle Counting in Massive Graphs"].

[[algorithms-triangle-count-syntax-anonymous]]
=== Anonymous graphs

It is also possible to execute the algorithm on a graph that is projected in conjunction with the algorithm execution.
In this case, the graph does not have a name, and we call it anonymous.
For more information, see <<algorithms-syntax>>.

.Run Triangle Count in write mode on an anonymous graph:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.triangleCount.write(
  configuration: Map
)
YIELD
  triangleCount: Integer,
  nodeCount: Integer,
  nodePropertiesWritten: Integer,
  createMillis: Integer,
  computeMillis: Integer,
  writeMillis: Integer,
  configuration: Map
----

include::../common-configuration/common-write-configuration-anonymous-graph.adoc[]

include::specific-configuration.adoc[]

The results are the same as for running write mode with a named graph, <<algorithms-triangle-count-syntax-write, specified above>>.
