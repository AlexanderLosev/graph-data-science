| Name                   | Type        | Default                | Optional | Description
| nodeLabels             | String[]    | ['*']                  | yes      | Filter the named graph using the given node labels.
| relationshipTypes      | String[]    | ['*']                  | yes      | Filter the named graph using the given relationship types.
| concurrency            | Integer     | 4                      | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for running the algorithm. Also provides the default value for 'writeConcurrency'.
| writeConcurrency       | Integer     | value of 'concurrency' | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for writing the result to Neo4j.
ifeval::["{entity}" == "relationship"]
| writeRelationshipType  | String      | n/a                    | no       | The relationship type used to persist the computed relationships in the Neo4j database.
endif::[]
| writeProperty          | String      | n/a                    | no       | The {entity} property in the Neo4j database to which the {result} is written.
