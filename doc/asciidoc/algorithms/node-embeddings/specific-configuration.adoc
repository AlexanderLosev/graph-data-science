| Name           | Type    | Default | Optional | Description
| steps          | Integer | 80      | yes      | The number of steps in a random walk.
| walksPerNode   | Integer | 10      | yes      | Number of random walks to compute for each node.
| inOutFactor    | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | The tendency of the random walk to stay close to the start node (BFS) or fan out in the graph (DFS). Higher value means stay local.
| returnFactor   | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | The tendency of the random walk to return to the last visited node. A value below 1.0 means a higher tendency.
| walkBufferSize | Integer | 1000    | yes      | Number of random walks to complete before starting training.
| dimensions     | Integer | 128     | yes      | The size of the embedding to compute.
| windowSize     | Integer | 10      | yes      | The size of the context window when training the neural network.
| learningRate   | Float   | 0.01    | yes      | The learning rate used for training the neural network.
| iterations     | Integer | 1       | yes      | Number of training iterations.
