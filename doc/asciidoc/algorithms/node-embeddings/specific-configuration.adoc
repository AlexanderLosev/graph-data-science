| Name                  | Type    | Default      | Optional | Description
| steps                 | Integer | 80           | yes      | The number of steps in a random walk.
| walksPerNode          | Integer | 10           | yes      | Number of random walks to starting at each node.
| inOutFactor           | Float   | 1.0          | yes      | The tendency of the random walk to stay close to the start node or fan out in the graph. Higher value means stay local.
| returnFactor          | Float   | 1.0          | yes      | The tendency of the random walk to return to the last visited node. A value below 1.0 means a higher tendency.
| walkBufferSize        | Integer | 1000         | yes      | Number of random walks to complete before starting training.
| dimensions            | Integer | 128          | yes      | The number of dimensions of the embedding vector.
| windowSize            | Integer | 10           | yes      | The size of the context window when training the neural network.
| learningRate          | Float   | 0.01         | yes      | The learning rate used for training the neural network.
| minLearningRate       | Float   | learningRate | yes      | Lower bound for learning rate as it is decreased during training.
| negativeSamplingRate  | Integer | 5            | yes      | The number of negative samples to produce for each positive sample.
| centerSamplingFactor  | Float   | 0.001        | yes      | The power used to reshape the center word sampling distribution. Higher values increase the probability that frequent words are down sampled.
| contextSamplingFactor | Float   | 0.75         | yes      | The power used to reshape the context word sampling distribution. A value of 1.0 samples proportionally to distribution. A value of 0.0 each word equally.
| iterations            | Integer | 1            | yes      | Number of training iterations.
