| Name                 | Type    | Default | Optional | Description
| steps                | Integer | 80      | yes      | The number of steps in a random walk.
| walksPerNode         | Integer | 10      | yes      | Number of random walks to starting at each node.
| inOutFactor          | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | The tendency of the random walk to stay close to the start node or fan out in the graph. Higher value means stay local.
| returnFactor         | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | The tendency of the random walk to return to the last visited node. A value below 1.0 means a higher tendency.
| walkBufferSize       | Integer | 1000    | yes      | Number of random walks to complete before starting training.
| dimensions           | Integer | 128     | yes      | The number of dimensions of the embedding vector.
| windowSize           | Integer | 10      | yes      | The size of the context window when training the neural network.
| learningRate         | Float   | 0.01    | yes      | The learning rate used for training the neural network.
| negativeSamplingRate | Integer | 5       | yes      | The number of negative samples to produce for each positive sample.
| iterations           | Integer | 1       | yes      | Number of training iterations.
