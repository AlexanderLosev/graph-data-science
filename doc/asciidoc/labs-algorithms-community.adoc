The following community detection algorithms evaluate how a group is clustered or partitioned, as well as its tendency to strengthen or break apart:

* <<labs-algorithms-strongly-connected-components, Strongly Connected Components>> (`algo.scc`)
* <<labs-algorithms-triangle-count-clustering-coefficient, Triangle Counting / Clustering Coefficient>> (`algo.triangleCount`)
* <<labs-algorithms-balanced-triads, Balanced Triads>> (`algo.balancedTriads`)
