= Experimental algorithms

[abstract]
--
This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the experimental algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

The Neo4j Graph Algorithms library contain a number of experimental algorithms developed and maintained as part of Neo4j Labs.
The experimental algorithms are accessed by via Cypher by calling procedures, just like the stable and supported algorithms.

[WARNING]
--
The experimental algorithms are not officially supported.
--

The documentation for the experimental algorithms is divided into the following sections:

* <<experimental-procedures>>
* <<experimental-algorithms-centrality>>
* <<experimental-algorithms-community>>
* <<experimental-algorithms-path-finding>>
* <<experimental-algorithms-similarity>>
* <<experimental-algorithms-linkprediction>>
* <<experimental-algorithms-preprocessing>>
