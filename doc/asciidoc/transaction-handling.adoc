[[tx-graph-loading]]
== During graph loading

When an algo is called from cypher, the procedure call is executed within the same
transaction as the cypher statement.

During loading, new transactions are used that do not inherit the transaction state
of the cypher transaction. This means that changes from the cypher transaction state
are not visible to the loading transactions.

For example, the following statement will not be able to load any nodes.

[EXAMPLE]
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n) SET n:MyLabel CALL algo.graph.load('graph-name', 'MyLabel', '')
----


[[tx-graph-writing]]
== During graph writing

Properties are written to the graph in new transactions for every chunk of 100000 nodes.
Those transactions are commited independently from the Cypher transaction.
This means that if the Cypher transaction is terminated (either by the user or by the database system), already committed write transactions will _not_ be rolled back.


[[tx-termination]]
== Transaction termination

The Cypher transaction can be terminated by either the user or the database system.
This will eventually terminate all transactions that have been opened during loading, writing, or the algorithm execution.
It is not immediately visible and can take a moment for the transactions to recognize that the Cypher transaction has been terminated.
