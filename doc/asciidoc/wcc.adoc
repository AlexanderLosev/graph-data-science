[[algorithms-wcc-intro]]
== Introduction

The WCC algorithm finds sets of connected nodes in an undirected graph, where all nodes in the same set form a connected component.
WCC is often used early in an analysis to understand the structure of a graph.

WCC was previously known as Union Find.
Currently, the WCC algorithm still uses the syntax of `algo.unionFind`.

// TODO: something about use cases

* One study uses WCC to work out how well connected the network is, and then to see whether the connectivity remains if 'hub' or 'authority' nodes are moved from the graph: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10115-003-0128-3["Characterizing and Mining Citation Graph of Computer Science Literature"^]

[[algorithms-wcc-examples]]
== Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (nAlice:User {name: 'Alice'})
CREATE (nBridget:User {name: 'Bridget'})
CREATE (nCharles:User {name: 'Charles'})
CREATE (nDoug:User {name: 'Doug'})
CREATE (nMark:User {name: 'Mark'})
CREATE (nMichael:User {name: 'Michael'})

CREATE (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 0.5}]->(nBridget)
CREATE (nAlice)-[:LINK {weight: 4}]->(nCharles)
CREATE (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 1.1}]->(nDoug)
CREATE (nMark)-[:LINK {weight: 2}]->(nMichael);
----

This graph has two connected components, each with three nodes.
The relationships that connect the nodes in each component have a property which determines the strength of the relationship.

We load this graph under the name `'wcc-graph'`, as below:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.graph.load('wcc-graph', 'User', 'LINK')
YIELD name AS Name, nodes AS Nodes, relationships AS Relationships
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m,1m"]
|===
| Name        | Nodes | Relationships
| "wcc-graph" | 6     | 4
|===


The following examples demonstrate using the Weakly Connected Components algorithm.


[[algorithms-wcc-examples-unweighted]]
=== Unweighted

.The following will run the algorithm and stream results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.unionFind.stream('User', 'LINK', {
  graph: 'wcc-graph'
})
YIELD nodeId, setId
RETURN algo.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, setId AS ComponentId
ORDER BY ComponentId
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| Name      | ComponentId
| "Alice"   | 0
| "Charles" | 0
| "Bridget" | 0
| "Michael" | 3
| "Doug"    | 3
| "Mark"    | 3
|===

To instead write the component ID to a node property in the Neo4j graph, use this query:

.The following will run the algorithm and write back results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.unionFind('User', 'LINK', {
  graph: 'wcc-graph',
  write: true,
  writeProperty: 'componentId'
})
YIELD nodes AS Nodes, setCount AS NbrOfComponents, writeProperty AS PropertyName;
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m,1m"]
|===
| Nodes | NbrOfComponents | PropertyName
| 6     | 2               | "componentId"
|===

As we can see from the results, the nodes connected to one another are calculated by the algorithm as belonging to the same connected component.


[[algorithms-wcc-examples-weighted]]
=== Weighted

By configuring the algorithm to use a weight (`weightProperty`) and a threshold, we can increase granularity in the way the algorithm calculates component assignment.
Only relationships with a weight strictly greater than the threshold value will be considered as a valid connection.

.The following will run the algorithm and stream results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.unionFind.stream('User', 'LINK', {
  graph: 'wcc-graph',
  weightProperty: 'weight',
  threshold: 1.0
})
YIELD nodeId,setId

RETURN algo.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, setId AS ComponentId
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| Name      | ComponentId
| "Alice"   | 0
| "Charles" | 0
| "Bridget" | 1
| "Doug"    | 3
| "Mark"    | 3
| "Michael" | 3
|===


.The following will run the algorithm and write back results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.unionFind('User', 'LINK', {
  graph: 'wcc-graph',
  write: true,
  writeProperty: "componentId",
  weightProperty: 'weight',
  threshold: 1.0
})
YIELD nodes AS Nodes, setCount AS NbrOfComponents, writeProperty AS PropertyName;
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m,1m"]
|===
| Nodes | NbrOfComponents | PropertyName
| 6     | 3               | "componentId"
|===

As we can see from the results, Bridget is now in their own component, due to the relationship weight not being above the configured threshold.


[[algorithms-wcc-examples-seeding]]
=== Seeded components

It is possible to define preliminary component IDs for nodes using the `seedProperty` configuration parameter.
This is helpful if we want to retain components from a previous run.
The property value needs to be a number.

The algorithm first checks if there is a seeded component ID assigned to the node.
If there is one, that component ID is used.
Otherwise, a new unique component ID is assigned to the node.

Once every node belongs to a component, the algorithm merges components of connected nodes.
When components are merged, the resulting component is always the one with the lower component ID.

[NOTE]
If the `seedProperty` configuration parameter has the same value as `writeProperty`, the algorithm only writes properties for nodes where the component ID has changed.
If they differ, the algorithm writes properties for all nodes.
