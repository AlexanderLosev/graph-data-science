This chapter provides instructions for installation and basic usage of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library is delivered as a plugin to the Neo4j Graph Database.
The plugin needs to be installed into the database and whitelisted in the Neo4j configuration.
There are two main ways of achieving this, which we will detail in this chapter.

== Neo4j Desktop

The most convenient way of installing the GDS library is through the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/neo4j-desktop/index.html[Neo4j Desktop^] plugin called Neo4j Graph Data Science.
The plugin can be found in the 'Plugins' tab of a database.

The installer will download the GDS library and install it in the 'plugins' directory of the database.
It will also add the following entry to the settings file:

----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----

This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.


== Neo4j Server

If you are using a standalone Neo4j Server, the library will need to be installed and configured manually.

1. Download `neo4j-graph-data-science-[version]-standalone.jar` from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/[Neo4j Download Center] and copy it into the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory.


2. Add the following to your `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----
This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.
+

3. Restart Neo4j


=== Verifying installation

To verify your installation, the library version can be printed by entering into the browser in Neo4j Desktop and calling the `gds.version()` function:

[source, cypher]
----
RETURN gds.version()
----

To list all installed algorithms, run the `gds.list()` procedure:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.list()
----
