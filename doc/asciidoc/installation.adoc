This chapter provides instructions for installation and basic usage of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library is delivered as a plugin to the Neo4j Graph Database.
The plugin needs to be installed into the database and whitelisted in the Neo4j configuration.
There are two main ways of achieving this, which we will detail in this chapter.


== Neo4j Desktop

The most convenient way of installing the GDS library is through the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/neo4j-desktop/index.html[Neo4j Desktop^] plugin called Neo4j Graph Data Science.
The plugin can be found in the 'Plugins' tab of a database.

The installer will download a the GDS library and install it in the 'plugins' directory of the database.
It will also add the following entry to the settings file:

----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----

This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.


== Neo4j Server

If we are using a standalone Neo4j Server, the library will need to be installed and configured manually.

1. Download `neo4j-graph-data-science-[version]-standalone.jar` from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/[Neo4j Download Center] and copy it into the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory.


2. Add the following to your `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----
This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.
+

3. Restart Neo4j


=== Verifying installation

To verify your installation, the library version can be printed by calling the `gds.version()` function:

[source, cypher]
----
RETURN gds.version()
----

To list all installed algorithms, run the `gds.list()` procedure:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.list()
----


== Usage

These algorithms are exposed as Neo4j procedures.
They can be called directly from Cypher in your Neo4j Browser, from cypher-shell, or from your client code.

For most algorithms there are two procedures:

* `algo.<name>` - this procedure writes results back to the graph as node-properties, and reports statistics.
* `algo.<name>.stream` - this procedure returns a stream of data.
For example, node-ids and computed values.
+
For large graphs, the streaming procedure might return millions, or even billions of results.
In this case it may be more convenient to store the results of the algorithm, and then use them with later queries.

The execution of any algorithm can be canceled by terminating the cypher transaction that is executing the procedure call.
For more on how transactions are used, see <<transaction-handling, Transaction Handling>>.
