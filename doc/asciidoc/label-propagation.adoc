= The Label Propagation algorithm

[abstract]
--
This section describes the Label Propagation algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

The Label Propagation algorithm (LPA) is a fast algorithm for finding communities in a graph.
It detects these communities using network structure alone as its guide, and doesn't require a pre-defined objective function or prior information about the communities.

One interesting feature of LPA is that nodes can be assigned preliminary labels to narrow down the range of solutions generated.
This means that it can be used as semi-supervised way of finding communities where we hand-pick some initial communities.

[[algorithms-label-propagation-intro]]
== Introduction

LPA works by propagating labels throughout the network and forming communities based on this process of label propagation.

The intuition behind the algorithm is that a single label can quickly become dominant in a densely connected group of nodes, but will have trouble crossing a sparsely connected region.
Labels will get trapped inside a densely connected group of nodes, and those nodes that end up with the same label when the algorithms finish can be considered part of the same community.

The algorithm works as follows:

* Every node is initialized with a unique community label (an identifier).
* These labels propagate through the network.
* At every iteration of propagation, each node updates its label to the one that the maximum numbers of its neighbours belongs to.
  Ties are broken uniformly and randomly.
* LPA reaches convergence when each node has the majority label of its neighbours.
* LPA stops if either convergence or the user-defined maximum number of iterations is achieved.

As labels propagate, densely connected groups of nodes quickly reach a consensus on a unique label.
At the end of the propagation only a few labels will remain - most will have disappeared.
Nodes that have the same community label at convergence are said to belong to the same community.

[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples]]
== Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (alice:User {name: 'Alice', seed_label: 52})
CREATE (bridget:User {name: 'Bridget', seed_label: 21})
CREATE (charles:User {name: 'Charles', seed_label: 43})
CREATE (doug:User {name: 'Doug', seed_label: 21})
CREATE (mark:User {name: 'Mark', seed_label: 19})
CREATE (michael:User {name: 'Michael', seed_label: 52})

CREATE (alice)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(bridget)
CREATE (alice)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 10}]->(charles)
CREATE (mark)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(doug)
CREATE (bridget)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(michael)
CREATE (doug)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(mark)
CREATE (michael)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(alice)
CREATE (alice)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(michael)
CREATE (bridget)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(alice)
CREATE (michael)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(bridget)
CREATE (charles)-[:FOLLOW {weight: 1}]->(doug)
----

This graph represents six users, some of whom follow each other.
Besides a `name` property, each user also has a `seed_label`  property.
The `seed_label` property represents a value in the graph used to seed the node with a label.
For example, this can be a result from a previous run of the Label Propagation algorithm.
In addition, each relationship has a weight property.

[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-unweighted]]
=== Unweighted

.The following will run the algorithm and stream results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.algo.labelPropagation.stream({
  nodeProjection: 'User',
  relationshipProjection: 'FOLLOW'
})
YIELD nodeId, communityId AS Community
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, Community
ORDER BY Community, Name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name    | Community
| "Alice"   | 1
| "Bridget" | 1
| "Michael" | 1
| "Charles" | 4
| "Doug"    | 4
| "Mark"    | 4
|===


.The following will load the graph, run the algorithm, and write back results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.algo.labelPropagation.write({
  nodeProjection: 'User',
  relationshipProjection: 'FOLLOW',
  writeProperty: 'community'
})
YIELD ranIterations, communityCount
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| ranIterations | communityCount
| 3             | 2
|===


Our algorithm found two communities, with 3 members each.

It appears that Michael, Bridget, and Alice belong together, as do Doug and Mark.
Only Charles doesn't strongly fit into either side, but ends up with Doug and Mark.

[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-weighted]]
=== Weighted

The Label-Propagation algorithm can also run on weighted graphs,
taking the given relationship or node weights into concern when forming the communities.

.The following will run the algorithm on a weighted graph and stream results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.algo.labelPropagation.stream({
  nodeProjection: 'User',
  relationshipProjection: 'FOLLOW',
  relationshipProperties: 'weight',
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight'
})
YIELD nodeId, communityId AS Community
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, Community
ORDER BY Community, Name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name    | Community
| "Bridget" | 2
| "Michael" | 2
| "Alice"   | 4
| "Charles" | 4
| "Doug"    | 4
| "Mark"    | 4
|===

Using the weighted relationships, `Alice` and `Charles` are now in the same community as there is a strong link between them.


.The following will load the graph, run the algorithm on a weighted graph and write back results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.algo.labelPropagation.write({
  nodeProjection: 'User',
  relationshipProjection: 'FOLLOW',
  relationshipProperties: 'weight',
  writeProperty: 'community',
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight'
})
YIELD ranIterations, communityCount
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| ranIterations | communityCount
| 4             | 2
|===

As we can see, the weighted example takes 4 iterations to converge, instead of 3 for the unweighted case.


[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-seeded]]
=== Seeded

At the beginning of the algorithm, every node is initialized with a unique label and the labels propagate through the network.

It is possible to define preliminary labels of nodes using the `seedProperty` parameter.
We need to store a preliminary set of labels that we would like to run the Label Propagation algorithm with as node properties.
That property needs to be a number.
In our example graph we saved them as the property `seed_label`.

The algorithm first checks if there is a seed label assigned to the node, and loads it if there is one.
If there isn't one, it assigns a new unique label to the node.
Using this preliminary set of labels, it then sequentially updates each node's label to a new one, which is the most frequent label among its neighbors at every iteration of label propagation.

.The following will run the algorithm with pre-defined labels:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.algo.labelPropagation.stream({
  nodeProjection: 'User',
  relationshipProjection: 'FOLLOW',
  nodeProperties: 'seed_label',
  seedProperty: 'seed_label'
})
YIELD nodeId, communityId AS Community
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, Community
ORDER BY Community, Name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name    | Community
| "Alice"   | 19
| "Bridget" | 19
| "Charles" | 19
| "Doug"    | 21
| "Mark"    | 21
| "Michael" | 21
|===

As we can see, the communities are based on the `seed_label` property, concretely `19` is from the user `Mark` and `21` from `Doug`.

.The following will load the graph, run the algorithm, and write back results:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.algo.labelPropagation.write({
  nodeProjection: 'User',
  relationshipProjection: 'FOLLOW',
  nodeProperties: 'seed_label',
  writeProperty: 'community',
  seedProperty: 'seed_label'
  })
YIELD ranIterations, communityCount
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| ranIterations | communityCount
| 3             | 2

[[algorithms-label-propagation-examples-projection]]
=== Cypher projection

In the examples above, we have relied on the _implicit_ loading of graphs for the algorithm computation.
However, like other algorithms WCC also accepts _named graphs_ and _Cypher projections_ as inputs.
See <<projected-graph-model, Projected Graph Model>> for more details.

.Using a named graph:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.beta.graph.create('myGraph', 'User', 'FOLLOW');

CALL gds.algo.labelPropagation.stream('myGraph', {})
YIELD nodeId, communityId AS Community
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, Community
ORDER BY Community, Name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name    | Community
| "Alice   | 1
| "Bridget" | 1
| "Michael" | 1
| "Charles" | 4
| "Doug"    | 4
| "Mark"    | 4
|===

As we can see, the results are identical to the results in the <<algorithms-label-propagation-examples-unweighted>> example.

.Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.algo.labelPropagation.stream({
  nodeQuery: 'MATCH (p:User) RETURN id(p) AS id',
  relationshipQuery: 'MATCH (p1:User)-[f:FOLLOW]->(p2:User)
    RETURN id(p1) AS source, id(p2) AS target',
  graph: 'cypher'
})
YIELD nodeId, communityId AS Community
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Name, Community
ORDER BY Community, Name
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name    | Community
| "Alice"   | 1
| "Bridget" | 1
| "Michael" | 1
| "Charles" | 4
| "Doug"    | 4
| "Mark"    | 4
|===

Again, results are identical, as the Cypher projection we use mimics the behaviour of the default loading configuration.
Of course, the Cypher projection feature enables more advanced control over which exact parts of the graph to compute over; please see <<cypher-projection>> for more details.

[[algorithms-label-propagation-usage]]
=== Usage

When executing LabelPropagation in parallel with direction 'BOTH', it is possible that results are flaky because of the asynchronous execution fashion of the algorithm.
This might also happen in an direction 'OUTGOING' graph, if two nodes have relationships that point to each other.
