= Algorithms

The Neo4j Graph Data Science library contains many graph algorithms.
The algorithms are divided into categories.
The categories are listed in this chapter.

Additionally, algorithms exist in one of three tiers of maturity:

* Production-quality
* Beta
* Alpha

The lower tiers are indicated in the syntax of the algorithm with either `alpha` or `beta`.
Production-quality algorithms are indicated by the lack of such a prefix.

This chapter is divided into the following sections:

* <<algorithms-syntax>>
* <<algorithms-centrality>>
* <<algorithms-community>>
* <<algorithms-graph-similarity>>
* <<algorithms-auxiliary>>
* <<labs-algorithms>>
