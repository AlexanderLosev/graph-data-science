= System Requirements

== Memory

The library operates completely on heap memory, which means we'll need to configure our Neo4j Server with a much larger heap size than we would for transactional workloads.
The diagram below shows how the library uses heap memory.

See <<memory-requirements>> for more details on the memory used by the projected graph model.

[[system-requirements-cpu]]
== CPU

The library uses multiple CPUs for data loading, processing, and writing back results.

[NOTE]
====
Up to 4 CPUs will be used when running the library on Neo4j Community Edition.
All CPUs will be used when running on Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
====

Most of the algorithms in the library run in parallel, by splitting up the nodes and assigning them to different threads that run part of the algorithm for that node.
