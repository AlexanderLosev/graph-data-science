This section explains native projections in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

A native projection allows us to project a graph from Neo4j into an in-memory graph.
The projected graph can be specified in terms of node labels, relationship types and properties.
Node labels and node properties are projected using <<native-projection-syntax-node-projections, Node projections>>.
Relationship types and relationship properties are projected using <<native-projection-syntax-relationship-projections, Relationship projections>>.

The main benefit of native projections is their performance.
In contrast, a <<cypher-projection, Cypher projection>> is more flexible from the declaration point of view, but less performant.
In most cases it is possible to structure your Neo4j graph model in a way that enables native projections to be used.

This section includes:

* <<native-projection-syntax, Syntax>>
* <<native-projection-syntax-node-projections, Node projections>>
* <<native-projection-syntax-relationship-projections, Relationship projections>>

== Syntax

A native projection takes three mandatory arguments: `graphName`, `nodeProjection` and `relationshipProjection`.
In addition, the optional `configuration` parameter allows us to further configure graph creation.

[[native-projection-syntax-node-projections]]
== Node projections

A node projection enables mapping Neo4j nodes into the in-memory graph.
When specifying a node projection, we can declare one or more node labels that we want to project.

The following map-like syntax shows the general way of defining node projections:

[source]
----
{
    <node-label-1>: {
        label: <neo4j-label>,
        properties: <node-property-mappings>
    },
    <node-label-2>: {
        label: <neo4j-label>,
        properties: <node-property-mappings>
    },
    // ...
    <node-label-n>: {
        label: <neo4j-label>,
        properties: <node-property-mappings>
    }
}
----

* `node-label-i` denotes the node label used in the projected graph
** `neo4j-label` denotes the node label in the Neo4j graph
*** The label must exist in the Neo4j database
*** If not specified, `neo4j-label` defaults to `node-label-i`
** `node-property-mappings` denotes a set of mappings between Neo4j and in-memory properties

In the following example, we want to project `Person` nodes into the in-memory graph.
The resulting graph contains all Neo4j nodes that have the label `Person`.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'my-graph', {
        Person: { label: 'Person' }
    },
    '*'
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

We can use the following shorthand syntax to project a single node label.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create('my-graph', 'Person', '*')
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

It is often useful to create an in-memory graph representing more than one node label.
Let's assume, the database contains `Person` and `City` nodes which we want to project.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'my-graph', {
        Person: { label: 'Person' },
        City: { label: 'City' }
    },
    '*'
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

The following shorthand syntax can be used to project multiple labels.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create('my-graph', ['Person', 'City'], '*')
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

To project all nodes in the Neo4j graph, we can use the special `*` ('star') node projection.
Note, that this node projection can not be combined with any other node label.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create('my-graph', '*', '*')
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

[NOTE]
====
In the in-memory graph, all projected node labels are merged into a single label.
Unlike for relationship projections, it is currently not possible to specify a filter on projected labels.
If the graph is used as input for an algorithm, all nodes will be considered.
====

=== Node properties

It is often useful to load an in-memory graph with more than one node property.
A typical scenario is running different seedable algorithms on the same graph, but with different node properties as seed.
We can load multiple node properties for each node projection using node property mappings.
A node property mapping maps a user-defined property key to a property key in the Neo4j database.
Any algorithm that supports node properties can refer to these user-defined property keys.

[source]
----
{
    <node-label>: {
        label: <neo4j-label>,
        properties: {
            <property-key-1>: {
                property: <neo-property-key>,
                defaultValue: <numeric-value>
            },
            <property-key-2>: {
                property: <neo-property-key>,
                defaultValue: <numeric-value>
            },
            // ...
            <property-key-n>: {
                property: <neo-property-key>,
                defaultValue: <numeric-value>
            }
        }
    }
}
----

* `property-key-i` denotes the property key in the projected graph
** `neo-property-key` denotes the property key in the Neo4j graph
*** The property key must exist in the Neo4j database
*** If not specified, `neo-property-key` defaults to `property-key-i`
** `numeric-value` is used if the property does not exist for a node
*** If not specified, `numeric-value` defaults to `NaN`


For the following example, let's assume that each `City` node stores two properties: the `population` of the city and an optional `stateId` that identifies the state in which the city is located.
We want to project both properties and project `stateId` to the custom property key `community`.

.Create a graph with multiple node properties:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'my-graph', {
        City: {
            properties: {
                stateId: {
                    property: 'stateId'
                },
                population: {
                    property: 'population'
                }
            }
        }
    },
    '*'
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

If we do not need to rename the node property keys or give a default value, we can use the following shorthand syntax.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create('my-graph', 'City', '*', {
        nodeProperties: ['population', 'stateId']
    }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

It is also possible to rename the property key during projection.
In the example, we project the property key `stateId` to a custom property key `community`.
When we use the projected graph in an algorithm, we refer to the custom property key instead.

.Project node properties for all projected node labels:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create('my-graph', 'City', '*', {
        nodeProperties: ['population', { community: 'stateId' }]
    }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

The projected properties can be referred to by any algorithm that uses properties as input, for example, <<algorithms-label-propagation, Label Propagation>>.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stream(
    'my-graph', {
        seedProperty: 'community'
    }
) YIELD nodeId, communityId;
----

[[native-projection-syntax-relationship-projections]]
== Relationship projections

A relationship projection defines how a specific subset of Neo4j relationships is projected into the in-memory graph.

The following map-like syntax shows the general way of defining relationship projections:

[source]
----
{
    <relationship-type-1>: {
        type: <neo4j-type>,
        orientation: <orientation>,
        aggregation: <aggregation-type>,
        properties: <relationship-property-mappings>
    },
    <relationship-type-2>: {
        type: <neo4j-type>,
        orientation: <orientation>,
        aggregation: <aggregation-type>,
        properties: <relationship-property-mappings>
    },
    // ...
    <relationship-type-n>: {
        type: <neo4j-type>,
        orientation: <orientation>,
        aggregation: <aggregation-type>,
        properties: <relationship-property-mappings>
    }
}
----

* `relationship-type-i` denotes the relationship type in the projected graph
** `neo4j-type` denotes the relationship type in the Neo4j graph
*** The relationship type must exist in the Neo4j database
*** If not specified, `neo4j-type` defaults to `relationship-type-i`
** `orientation` denotes how Neo4j relationships are represented in the projected graph.
    The following values are allowed:
*** `NATURAL`: each relationship is projected the same way as it is stored in Neo4j (default)
*** `REVERSE`: each relationship is reversed during graph projection
*** `UNDIRECTED`: each relationship is projected in both natural and reverse orientation
** `aggregation-type` denotes how parallel relationships and their properties are handled.
    The specified value is applied to all property mappings that have no aggregation specified.
    The following values are allowed:
*** `NONE`: parallel relationships are not aggregated (default)
*** `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`: applied to the numeric properties of parallel relationships
*** `SINGLE`: a single, arbitrary relationship out of the parallel relationships is projected
** `relationship-property-mappings` denotes a set of mappings between Neo4j and in-memory relationship properties


In the following example, we want to project `City` nodes as well as `ROAD` and `RAIL` relationships into the in-memory graph.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'my-graph',
    'City',
    {
        ROAD: {
            type: 'ROAD',
            orientation: 'NATURAL'
        },
        RAIL: {
            type: 'RAIL',
            orientation: 'NATURAL'
        }
    }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

In the above example, we are using the same relationship type as in the Neo4j database as well as the default `orientation`.
In that case we can use the following syntactic sugar, similar to node projections.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create( 'my-graph', 'City', ['ROAD', 'RAIL'])
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

Projecting multiple relationship types enables algorithms to only use a subset of those.

[source,cypher]
----
// Uses `ROAD` relationships for computing Page Rank of cities
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('my-graph', { relationshipTypes: ['ROAD'] }) YIELD nodeId, score;

// Uses `RAIL` relationships for computing Page Rank of cities
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('my-graph', { relationshipTypes: ['RAIL'] }) YIELD nodeId, score;
----


=== Projection orientation

By default, relationships are projected in their natural representation, i.e., in the same way as they are stored in Neo4j.
Using the `orientation` key within a relationship projection definition, we can alter that behaviour.
There are three possible values: `NATURAL`, `REVERSE` and `UNDIRECTED` which can be best described from a node's perspective:

* `NATURAL` is the default behaviour and projects relationships that are pointing away from a node.
* `REVERSE` projects relationships that are pointing towards a node.
* `UNDIRECTED` projects relationships in both, natural and reversed order.

Consider the following graph containing `Person` nodes connected by `KNOWS` relationships.
A `KNOWS` relationship is directed, as one person might know another person, but not necessarily the other way around.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'})
CREATE (bob:Person {name: 'Bob'})
CREATE (eve:Person {name: 'Eve'})

CREATE (alice)-[:KNOWS]->(bob)
CREATE (bob)-[:KNOWS]->(eve)
CREATE (eve)-[:KNOWS]->(bob);
----

In a `NATURAL` projection, Alice has one relationship to Bob, Bob has one relationship to Eve who in turn also has one relationship to Bob.
In a `REVERSE` projection, Alice has no relationships as there is no relationship pointing towards Alice.
Bob and Eve would have one relationship each, as they point to each other.
In an `UNDIRECTED` projection, Alice would have one relationship representing the outgoing relationship.
However, Bob and Eve would have two relationships each as the outgoing and incoming relationships are viewed independently.

To create a graph projection with different projection types, we use the following syntax:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'my-graph',
    'Person',
    {
        KNOWS: {
            type: 'KNOWS',
            orientation: 'NATURAL'
        },
        KNOWN_BY: {
            type: 'KNOWS',
            orientation: 'REVERSE'
        },
        FRIEND_OF: {
            type: 'KNOWS',
            orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
        }
    }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

As in the previous example, we can refer to a subset of the projected relationships when running an algorithm.
If we run the examples, we can see different ranks for the individual nodes.
The Page Rank algorithm evenly distributes ranks along the relationships of a node.
In the reverse case, Alice has no relationships which leads to a different result.

[source,cypher]
----
// Uses `KNOWS` relationships for computing Page Rank of persons
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('my-graph', { relationshipTypes: ['KNOWS'] }) YIELD nodeId, score;

// Uses `KNOWN_BY` relationships for computing Page Rank based on reversed relationships
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('my-graph', { relationshipTypes: ['KNOWN_BY'] }) YIELD nodeId, score;

// Uses `FRIEND_OF` relationships for computing Page Rank based on both projection types
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('my-graph', { relationshipTypes: ['FRIEND_OF'] }) YIELD nodeId, score;
----

[NOTE]
====
Creating a projection consumes additional memory as those projections are stored in individual in-memory data structures.
Sometimes it is possible to combine relationship projections instead of creating a new one.
In the above example, the `FRIEND_OF` projection is equivalent to using `['KNOWS', 'KNOWN_BY']` as a relationship type predicate.
This is not possible, if we use different aggregations for the single projections.
====

=== Relationship properties

Similar to node properties, relationship projections support specifying relationship properties.
We can specify multiple relationship properties for each relationship projection using relationship property mappings.
A relationship property mapping maps a user-defined property key to a property key in the Neo4j database.
The parameter is configured using a map in which each key refers to a user-defined property key.

The following map-like syntax shows the general way of defining relationship property mappings:

[source]
----
{
    <relationship-type-1>: {
        type: <neo4j-type>,
        orientation: <orientation-type>,
        aggregation: <aggregation-type>,
        properties: {
            <property-key-1>: {
                property: <neo4j-property-key>,
                defaultValue: <numeric-value>,
                aggregation: <aggregation-type>
            },
            <property-key-2>: {
                property: <neo4j-property-key>,
                defaultValue: <numeric-value>,
                aggregation: <aggregation-type>
            },
            // ...
            <property-key-n>: {
                property: <neo4j-property-key>,
                defaultValue: <numeric-value>,
                aggregation: <aggregation-type>
            }
        }
    }
}
----

* `property-key-i` denotes the name of the property in the projected graph
** `neo4j-property-key` denotes the name of the property in the Neo4j graph
*** The property key must exist in the Neo4j database
*** `neo4j-property-key` defaults to `property-key-i`
** `numeric-value` is used if the property does not exist for a relationship
*** `numeric-value` defaults to `NaN`
** `aggregation-type` denotes how properties of parallel relationships are handled.
    The specified value overrides the aggregation type specified for the enclosing relationship projection.
    The following values are allowed:
*** `NONE`: parallel relationships are not aggregated (default)
*** `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`: applied to the numeric properties of parallel relationships
*** `SINGLE`: a single, arbitrary relationship out of the parallel relationships is projected

In the following example, we want to project `City` nodes and `ROAD` relationships.
For nodes we project the `stateId` property.

.Create a graph with multiple node and relationship properties:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'my-graph', {
        City: {
            properties: {
                community: {
                    property: 'stateId'
                }
            }
        }
    }, {
        ROAD: {
            properties: {
                quality: {
                    property: 'condition'
                },
                distance: {
                    property: 'length'
                }
            }
        }
    }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

We can use the following shorthand syntax to express the same projection.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'my-graph', 'City', 'ROAD', {
        nodeProperties: { community: 'stateId' },
        relationshipProperties: [{ quality: 'condition' }, { distance: 'length' }]
    }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

The projected properties can be referred to by any algorithm that uses properties as input, for example <<algorithms-label-propagation, Label Propagation>>.

[source,cypher]
----
// Option 1: Use the road quality as relationship weight
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stream(
    'my-graph', {
        seedProperty: 'community',
        relationshipWeightProperty: 'quality'
    }
) YIELD nodeId, communityId;
// Option 2: Use the distance between cities as relationship weight
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stream(
    'my-graph', {
        seedProperty: 'community',
        relationshipWeightProperty: 'distance'
    }
) YIELD nodeId, communityId;
----


=== Relationship aggregations

Relationship projections offer different ways of handling multiple - so called "parallel" - relationships between a given pair of nodes.
The default is the `NONE` aggregation which keeps all parallel relationships and directly projects them into the in-memory graph.
All other aggregations project all the parallel relationships between a pair of nodes into a single relationship.

In the following example, we want to aggregate all `ROAD` relationships between two cities to a single relationship.
While doing so, we compute the maximum quality of the parallel relationships and store it on the resulting relationship.

.Create a graph with aggregated parallel relationships:
[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'my-graph', {
        City: {
            properties: {
                community: {
                    property: 'stateId'
                }
            }
        }
    }, {
        ROAD: {
            properties: {
                maxQuality: {
                    property: 'condition',
                    aggregation: 'MAX',
                    defaultValue: 1.0
                }
            }
        }
    }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

Since we have only one node projection and one relationship projection, we can use the following shorthand syntax.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'my-graph', 'City', 'ROAD', {
        nodeProperties: { community: 'stateId' },
        relationshipProperties: { maxQuality: { property: 'condition', aggregation: 'MAX', defaultValue: 1.0 }}
    }
)
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount;
----

As before, the projected properties can be referred to by any algorithm that uses properties as input, for example <<algorithms-label-propagation, Label Propagation>>.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.labelPropagation.stream(
    'my-graph', {
        seedProperty: 'community',
        relationshipWeightProperty: 'maxQuality'
    }
) YIELD nodeId, communityId;
----
