= Centrality algorithms

[abstract]
--
This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the centrality algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Centrality algorithms are used to determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network.
The Neo4j GDS library includes the following centrality algorithms, grouped by quality tier:

* Production-quality:
** <<algorithms-pagerank, PageRank>>
* Alpha
** <<algorithms-articlerank, ArticleRank>>
** <<algorithms-betweenness-centrality, Betweenness Centrality>>
** <<algorithms-closeness-centrality, Closeness Centrality>>
** <<algorithms-degree-centrality, Degree Centrality>>
** <<algorithms-eigenvector, Eigenvector Centrality>>
