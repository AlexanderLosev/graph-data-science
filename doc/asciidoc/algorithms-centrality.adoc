[[algorithms-centrality]]
= Centrality algorithms

[abstract]
--
This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the centrality algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

The following centrality algorithms determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network:

* <<algorithms-pagerank, PageRank>> (`algo.pageRank`)
* <<algorithms-betweenness-centrality, Betweenness Centrality>> (`algo.betweenness`)
* <<algorithms-closeness-centrality, Closeness Centrality>> (`algo.closeness`)
* <<algorithms-degree-centrality, Degree Centrality>> (`algo.degree`)
