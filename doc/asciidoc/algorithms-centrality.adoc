= Centrality algorithms

[abstract]
--
This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the centrality algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.
--

Centrality algorithms are used to determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network.
Neo4j GDS includes the following centrality algorithms, grouped by quality tier:

* Production-quality:
** <<algorithms-pagerank, PageRank>> (`algo.pageRank`)
* Alpha
** <<algorithms-articlerank, ArticleRank>> (`algo.articleRank`)
** <<algorithms-betweenness-centrality, Betweenness Centrality>> (`algo.betweenness`)
** <<algorithms-closeness-centrality, Closeness Centrality>> (`algo.closeness`)
** <<algorithms-degree-centrality, Degree Centrality>> (`algo.degree`)
** <<algorithms-eigenvector, Eigenvector Centrality>> (`algo.eigenvector`)
