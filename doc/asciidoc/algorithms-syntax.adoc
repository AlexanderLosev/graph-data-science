== Syntax overview

The general algorithm syntax comes in two variants:

* Named graph variant
** The graph to operate over will be read from the graph catalog.
* Anonymous graph variant
** The graph to operate over will be created and deleted as part of the algorithm execution.

Additional to the syntax variants are execution modes.
There are three supported execution modes:

* `stream`
** Returns the result of the algorithm as a stream of records.
* `write`
** Writes the results of the algorithm to the Neo4j database and returns a single record of summary statistics.
* `stats`
** Returns a single record of summary statistics, but does not write to the Neo4j database.

Finally, each execution mode may be estimated (read more in the section on estimation) by suffixing the command with `estimate`.

Including all above elements leads to these syntax outlines:

.Syntax composition for the named graph variant:
[source]
----
CALL gds[.<tier>].<algorithm-name>.<execution-mode>[.<estimate>](
  graphName: STRING,
  configuration: MAP
)
----

.Syntax composition for the anonymous graph variant:
[source]
----
CALL gds[.<tier>].<algorithm-name>.<execution-mode>[.<estimate>](
  configuration: MAP
)
----

`[]` is used to denote optional parts of the syntax.

The detailed sections in this chapter include concrete syntax overviews and examples.
